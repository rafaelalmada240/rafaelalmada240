- 👋 Hi, I’m @rafaelalmada240
- 👀 I’m interested in physics/networks in general, but specially in random networks and dynamical systems theory applied to statistical physics problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD student at the University of Lisbon
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on any project involving deriving models from datasets and giving physical insight into data. Also, anything relating to signal/image processing 
- 📫 How to reach me : rafaelalmada240497@gmail.com
